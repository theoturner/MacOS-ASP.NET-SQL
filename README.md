# MacOS wireframe ASP.NET app using MySQL EntityFramework and Identity.

Visual Studio and C# .NET still have teething issues. This is a wireframe ASP.NET MVC app that links a web front-end with a MySQL database. It can be used while Microsoft iron out SQL issues in MacOS VS (hopefully with VS 2019).

Note that .NET Core 2.1 has a bug preventing value conversions with MySQL - this has been acknowledged by the devs and a fix is presumably on the way. For now this app runs .NET Core 2.0.
